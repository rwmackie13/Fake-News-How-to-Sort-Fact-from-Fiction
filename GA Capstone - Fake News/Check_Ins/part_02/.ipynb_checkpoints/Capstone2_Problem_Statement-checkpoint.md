# Capstone Check-In 2 - Tracking Political Disinformation

### Problem Statement

**With the upcoming 2020 election nearing, the news we gather is a critical resource in deciding which candidate we will be supporting. As has been discussed many times since that 2016 presidential election, Fake News is a danger to each and everyone of us. Fact checking every story has become tedious and time consuming, so automating Fake News detection has become critical. The goal of this project is to train a classifier model on fake news data and then build an app that can detect Fake News in real time.**

#### Considered Models
 - Passive Aggressive Classifier
 - LSTM
 - CNN
 - SVM
 
#### Data Collection Process
 - Will be starting off using a kaggle dataset which consists of a training set of 20000 unique values and a testing set of 5000 unique values.
 - After training a model on the kaggle data, will begin working with twitter data to predict the reliability of new articles

#### Success Metrics
 - I think this is likely the hardest part of this project.
 - Instead of deciding if a particular news source is either 1-0 (true-false), it might be best to include predicted probabilities and give the client a heads up on if something is likely to be true if over a certain threshold.
 - Still need to work through this issue
 
#### Other Issues
 - I like this project, but I am not sure it will be a good enough project for a capstone. One that can showcase all of what we have learned.
 - I have not had much time to work on this yet due to the group project.
